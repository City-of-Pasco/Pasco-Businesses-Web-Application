## Project Description

Create and develop an interactive web application for the City of Pasco that showcases proprietor-entered business data. Users can utilize this application to explore the City of Pasco’s downtown businesses and relevant information. Our project will also support the City of Pasco’s vision and goals of 1) Active and safe streets and public spaces for all, 2) A downtown that reflects Pasco’s History, People, and Culture, and 3) Robust and Collaborative Downtown Management.
